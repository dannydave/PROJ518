## Project Overview

This repository contains the complete code, data analysis process, and machine learning models developed for my MSc Dissertation project titled "Heart Disease Diagnosis using Machine Learning and Data Mining."

The primary aim of the project is to leverage supervised machine learning algorithms to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient data. This work addresses key challenges in healthcare diagnostics, including handling imbalanced datasets and identifying the most relevant clinical features for accurate prediction.

## Project Objectives

* Perform data cleaning, normalization, and feature selection to curate a robust dataset.

* Develop classification models using supervised algorithms: Random Forest, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

* Compare model performance using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix, and ROC-AUC.

* Identify key clinical features contributing to the diagnosis.

* Build a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Tkinter to allow user-friendly predictions.
  

## Dataset

Source

* Combined dataset from IEEEDataport, incorporating data from:

* Cleveland Clinic Foundation

* Fasting Blood Sugar

* Resting ECG

* Max Heart Rate

* Exercise-Induced Angina

* Oldpeak (ST Depression)

* ST Slope

## Methodology

Data Preprocessing:

* Handling missing values

* Normalization and scaling

* Feature selection using statistical tests and model-based ranking

Model Development:
